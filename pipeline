"Adjusting  the data by cpm or total count scaling introduces more variability to
the  data,  whereas  all  other  methods  resulted  in  more  similar
distribution  across  all  samples."
" The distributions are more similar and centered
at zero when the data are normalized using UQ, TMM, DESeq,
cyclic loess and quantile normalizations"
"UQ  and  TMM  decreased  the  variance  across  all miRNAs compared with the raw data"
R statistical environment (v3.1.2)
Bioconductor  (3.0)
Cyclic loess and quantile normalization were performed using  the normalizeBetweenArrays() function  in  the  limma package (v3.22.4)
TMM and UQ normalizations were performed using calcNormFactors() in the edgeR (v3.8.5) package
the  function estimateSizeFactors() in  the  DESeq (v1.18.0) package was used to normalize the count data using size
factors
